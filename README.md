# Smart-Workers-Tracking-System-Using-Computer-Vision

## Introduction
The construction industry, characterized by its ever-evolving landscapes and high-risk activities, is a sector where safety and efficiency are Adjective. It is a field that demands constant caution, as workers navigate through a plenty of potential hazards daily. 

A critical aspect of construction safety is the mandatory use of personal protective equipment (PPE), including safety vests and hardhats. These are not mere accessories; they are vital tools that protect workers from common hazards. 

So....

Human behaviour is diverse and varied, making identifying human-object interactions difficult. Human movement tracking systems can help optimize workflow on construction sites. 

Systems that track and analyze the movements of specific persons or groups of people are known as human movement tracking systems, and their use in various sectors is growing.

and that will lead to.....

## Problem Statement

High Accident Risk: Construction sites are prone to accidents due to complex hazards, which require improved safety monitoring.

Safety Gear Non-Compliance: Inconsistent use of essential safety equipment like hardhats and vests by construction workers leads to increased injury risks.

Behavioral Monitoring Challenges: The diversity in worker behavior and interactions on construction sites complicates effective safety and efficiency monitoring.
